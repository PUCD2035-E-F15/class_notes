# Assignment

At this point you should have a clear picture of what your are making for your final assignment. You should also have the bulk of the illustration/graphics production complete. Over the next week you will build and refine your final project. Much of this work will be programming. For next week get a good start by creating a Proof of Concept (POC) showing that you will be able to achieve your goals.

1. Identify the more complex technical areas of your project.
2. Build a rough version of your project that shows these parts of the project.
3. Focus on getting the code working, you can work on polish after.
4. By creating this POC you will identify areas that will require additional time and/or research early, while you have time to plan for difficulties.
5. Bring your POC project with you to class to work on and discuss.
