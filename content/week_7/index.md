# Illustration Assigment

Create an interactive illustration based on a single line from a children’s book, poem, novel, or song lyric.

Begin by choosing the line. Using that line as a starting point, create a interactive illustration in p5. Your illustration should be based solely on the line you choose, **as if you had never read the rest of the book**. Your illustration should be an entirely new work. It should not follow the style of your chosen book. It should feature no recognizable characters from your source book or other works.

Create the elements for your illustration using traditional (non-digital) media. Your elements must be made by you, from scratch. Scan or photograph your elements and prepare them in Photoshop (scan it, retouch it, crop it, size it, export it). Your sketch should use only image assets to create visuals. Don’t use rect(), ellipse(), etc. Your sketch should include your chosen. This text should be treated as part of the illustration and composition, and should be created on paper like the other elements. **In short, illustrate your text.**

You will use p5 to combine these elements into a single illustration. Use concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals to create you illustration out of your elements, just like you did with rects and circles. **Your illustration must be interactive.** Your illustration should have at least three elements that react to changes in mouse position and/or button state.Adding more animated or interactive elements may improve your grade. Like in the first two assignments, you should explore. Your technical goal in this assignment is to apply and demonstrate the coding skills we have introduced in class.

**This will be the first project that we critique in class** In addition to technical aspects, this assignment will be evaluated in terms of aesthetics, concept, and craft. In particular think about how interaction can support the meaning of your illustration.

We will be critiquing this work next week. We will look at everyone’s project and code; be prepared to talk about each other’s work.

As usual, fork and clone the [assignment repo](https://github.com/PUCD2035-E-F15/assignment_illustration) to get started. Submit your final work by syncing it to github before start of class next week.
