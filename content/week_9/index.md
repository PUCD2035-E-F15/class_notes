## Assignment

Create a new brush/tool for the paint program. Your tool can do almost anything, but try to stick to these guidelines: 

- Your tool should be controlled, in some way, by the user.
- Your tool should not completely clear the exiting drawing.
- Your tool should change the drawing, leaving behind some kind of mark.
- Your tool should use the global `forecolor` variable, but it doesn't have to use it for color.

Next week we will add everyone's brushes into the app, and review the resulting app. We will have a small crit of each brush, and also discuss the emergent properties of the overall app.

We will also vote on the following awards:

- Most Useful Brush
- Best simulation of a natural media
- Funniest Brush
- Strangest
-
