<blockquote>
<p>Initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals within a visual context, Processing evolved into a development tool for professionals. Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.</p>

<h3>The Processing Development Environment</h3>
<p><a href="http://processing.org/">The Processing Website</a></p>
<p>An IDE is an Integrated Programming Environment. It allows you to edit your code, build your program, and see the result. A Processing project is called a Sketch, it is stored as a folder of files on your drive.</p>
<h3>The Processing Reference</h3>
<p><a href="http://processing.org/reference/">Processing Reference</a></p>
<p>You will need to refer the processing reference page frequently as you code. If you have the Processing IDE open, you should have this webpage open too.</p>
<h3>The Processing Language and API</h3>
<p>Processing includes a wide selection of example code. Look at some of the examples included with the PDE. Think about what they do and read the code. You might not understand everything, but this is a great way to start.</p>
<h3>Demo: Drawing With Processing</h3>
<p>This is a very simple example showing a few Processing drawing commands.</p>
