<h1>Assignment</h1>
<p>At this point you should have a clear picture of what your are making for your final assignment. You should also have the bulk of the illustration/graphics production complete. Over the next week you will build and refine your final project. Much of this work will be programming. For next week get a good start by creating a Proof of Concept (POC) showing that you will be able to achieve your goals.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the more complex technical areas of your project.</li>
<li>Build a rough version of your project that shows these parts of the project.</li>
<li>Focus on getting the code working, you can work on polish after.</li>
<li>By creating this POC you will identify areas that will require additional time and/or research early, while you have time to plan for difficulties.</li>
<li>Bring your POC project with you to class to work on and discuss.</li>
</ol>
